# Question 1

After cloning the git repository, please run:
## `mvn spring-boot:run`

After this finishes, open a browser and go to:
##`localhost:8080`

This will bring you to a simple page with a text field. Type in a valid integer and click the `Get primes` button.
The result should show up on the page.


#Question 2

The class definition as the answer to this question can be found in sieve-of-eratosthenes/src/main/java/com/group/eratosthenes/questiontwo/ package.
Since this was simple a single file, I saw no need to create a separate repository for it and simply included in a package of its own in the eratosthenes project.

Thank you
